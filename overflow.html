            Dr Jason Whitney was sitting alone and having a cup of coffee in a lovely morning. In such
            moment, he saw two federal agents entering the restaurant with another guy. Out of curiosity,
            the doctor asked them about the unknown guy. Then Joe Moffet, associate of Tom Campbell,
            responded that the unknown guy was named Hammond and he was involved with money scam
            of several banks and also added that he was refusing to talk about that secret news. Then, Dr
            Whitney informed them that he knows a professional hypnotist who could hypnotize people
            and leak their information easily. Joe and Tom felt interested and asked Dr Whitney for the
            address of the hypnotist. But Dr Whitney told them he would take Hammond to the hypnotist
            with his own obligation and take all the news in secret. Campbell and Joe agreed with Dr
            Whitney. Next morning, Dr Whitney got Hammond in a hidden room where he brought patients
            and snatched their money by hypnotizing them. When the doctor started to hypnotize,
            Hammond acts as if he had been hypnotized by him and giving all the answers what he had
            already prepared for Dr Whitney. Thus, Hammond smartly exposed Dr Whitney’s mask and
            promoted himself by handing over all the money he earned in a wrong route to the
            government. In reality, Henry Hammond was a secret police service agent who serves for
            catching criminals like Dr Whitney.Dr Jason Whitney was sitting alone and having a cup of coffee in a lovely
